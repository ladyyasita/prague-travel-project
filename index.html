<div><h2>Why Prague</h2>
<h3>The City of a Hundred Spires</h3>
<p>Prague is a political, cultural, and economic hub of Central Europe, with a rich history 
  and Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque architectures.   It was the capital of the 
  Kingdom of Bohemia and residence of several Holy
 Roman Emperors, most notably Charles IV (r. 1346-1378) and Rudolf II (r. 1575-1611).</p>
 <p>The physical attractions and landmarks of Prague are many. Among
   the finest is the Charles   
  Bridge (Karlův most), which stands astride the Vltava River.
 The winding course of the Vltava, with its succession of bridges 
  and changing vistas, contrasts with the ever-present backdrop of the    great 
  castle of Hradčany (Prague Castle), which dominates the left-bank 
  region of the city from behind massive walls set high on a hill. The narrow 
  streets and little taverns and restaurants of the older quarters contrast with
 the broad sweep of Wenceslas Square and modern parks and housing developments, while 
 the great 18th-century Baroque palaces have their own elegance and splendour. </p>

   <div class="card-body"> <h4>Cafe Slavia</h4>
    <p>The Café Slavia (Kavárna Slavia) is the most famous coffee 
      shop in the Czech Republic and has become one of the symbols of Prague: 
      of the city’s tempestuous history, rich intellectual life and local lifestyle. 
      Standing opposite the National Theatre, the café is, however, also a symbol of how the
       Czechs think of themselves as a nation, and how they see each other.</p>

       <h4>Pub Lokal</h4>
    <p>Lokál Dlouhááá has won the hearts of many for its authentic beer hall
       atmosphere and convivial setting, though a handful of patrons find the 
       ambiance wanting. Guests commend the traditional Czech fare for its heartiness 
       and generous portions, offering good value, although a few note the flavors could
       be more pronounced.</p>

<h4>Savoy cafe</h4>
<p>The Art Nouveau Café Savoy, located on the west bank of the Vltava river near Kampa park,
   is one of Prague's grand cafés. First opened in 1893, it was recently restored to its former 
   beauty and has since become a favourite meeting spot for both locals and tourists.</p>
