<div><h2>Why Prague</h2>
<h3>The City of a Hundred Spires</h3>
<p>Prague is a political, cultural, and economic hub of Central Europe, with a rich history 
  and Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque architectures.   It was the capital of the 
  Kingdom of Bohemia and residence of several Holy
 Roman Emperors, most notably Charles IV (r. 1346-1378) and Rudolf II (r. 1575-1611).</p>
 <p>The physical attractions and landmarks of Prague are many. Among
   the finest is the Charles   
  Bridge (Karlův most), which stands astride the Vltava River.
 The winding course of the Vltava, with its succession of bridges 
  and changing vistas, contrasts with the ever-present backdrop of the    great 
  castle of Hradčany (Prague Castle), which dominates the left-bank 
  region of the city from behind massive walls set high on a hill. The narrow 
  streets and little taverns and restaurants of the older quarters contrast with
 the broad sweep of Wenceslas Square and modern parks and housing developments, while 
 the great 18th-century Baroque palaces have their own elegance and splendour. </p>
